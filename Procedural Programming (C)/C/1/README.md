# Unit 1
* [10.c](./10.c): Estimates the height of a person based on their weight. The user inputs the weight (in kilograms), and the program uses a formula to calculate the estimated height in centimeters, rounding it up to the nearest whole number, and then prints the result.

* [11.c](./11.c): Calculates the total cost of an order. The user inputs the price per package, the VAT percentage, and the number of packages. The program then computes the total cost by multiplying the price per package by the number of packages, adding the VAT amount, and outputs the final total cost.

* [12.c](./12.c): Calculates the municipal tax and municipal fee for a house based on its clean area and mixed area. It uses predefined rates and prorates them over a year to compute and display the values.

* [13.c](./13.c): Finds the average grade of a student by summing the grades of three semesters (A, B, and C) and then dividing the total by 3. It then displays the average grade.

* [14.c](./14.c): Calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the provided weight, height, and age, and then displays the result.

* [2.c](./2.c): Calculates the area of a right triangle by multiplying the lengths of two sides and dividing by 2, then displays the result.

* [3.c](./3.c): Determines how many containers of sizes 50, 20, 5, and 1 are needed to store a given number of household appliances. The user inputs the number of appliances, and the program divides this number by 50, 20, 5, and 1, figuring out how many of each container size are required, and then prints the result.

* [4.c](./4.c): Calculates the profit based on the purchase amount and profit percentage, then computes the total sale amount by adding the profit to the purchase amount, and displays both values.

* [5.c](./5.c): Computes the gross income by multiplying the work hours by the hourly wage, then determines the deductions based on the given percentage. Finally, it adds the deductions to the gross income to compute the net income

* [6.c](./6.c): Calculates the gift amount based on the number of workdays, daily salary, and the percentage of the gift. It multiplies the total earnings (workdays * daily salary) by the gift percentage to find the gift amount.

* [7.c](./7.c): Computes the total value-added tax (VAT or FPA) based on different tax rates. The user inputs the total revenue for three different VAT rates (0.04, 0.08, and 0.18). The program calculates the VAT for each revenue amount by multiplying it by the corresponding rate, then sums them to get the total VAT amount, which is displayed to the user.

* [8.c](./8.c): Estimates the total shipping cost for domestic and international mail. The user provides the number of domestic and international mail items, and the program calculates the shipping cost by multiplying the number of domestic items by 0.3 and the number of international items by 0.8. It then outputs the total shipping cost.

* [9.c](./9.c): Computes the discount and the final payment amount for an item. The user inputs the price of the item and the discount percentage. The program calculates the discount and subtracts it from the original price to determine the payment amount, then prints both the discount and the final amount to be paid.
