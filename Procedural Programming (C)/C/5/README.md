# Unit 5

* [1.c](./1.c): Calculates and displays the breakdown of a series of amounts into various denominations of currency (e.g., 10000, 5000, 1000, 500, 200, etc.). 

* [10.c](./10.c): Estimates the number of 50, 20, 5, and 1 units needed to make up a given amount N, and prints the count for each denomination.

* [11.c](./11.c): Calculates and displays the national average temperature, average temperature per city, and the maximum deviation of city temperatures from the national average based on a 10-city, 3-period dataset.

* [11b.c](./11b.c): Calculates the national average temperature, each city’s average, and the maximum deviation from the national average based on temperature data for 10 cities over 3 time periods. Results include the national average, city averages, and deviations.

* [12.c](./12.c): Displays the grades of students for multiple subjects, converting them from a 100-point scale to a 20-point scale. It also computes the average score for each student in both scales.

* [13.c](./13.c): Generates a matrix of random integers, displays it, modifies rows such that all elements before the maximum element in each row are replaced by the maximum, and then displays the updated matrix.

* [14.c](./14.c): Reads an array of integers, finds the maximum value, counts its occurrences, and identifies its positions in the array, displaying the results.

* [15.c](./15.c): Generates an array of 100 random integers, displays it, and then prompts the user for a number. It creates a new array containing only the elements greater than the entered number, displays the count of such elements, and prints the new array. However, it contains errors in parameter handling for ReadNumber and NewArray.

* [16.c](./16.c): Generates an array of 50 random numbers between 0 and 9, then prompts the user to input a number between 0 and 9. It counts how many times the number appears in the array and prints the positions where it occurs.

* [17.c](./17.c): Collects scores for 10 students across 3 subjects, calculates their average score, counts how many are excellent (average ≥ 18.5) and failed (average < 9.5), and computes the percentage of students in each category. It then prints the results.

* [18.c](./18.c): Calculates the maximum charge for each month, based on user input for each day of the month, and then determine which month has the highest maximum charge day.

* [19.c](./19.c): Creates a 3x4 two-dimensional array, initializes each element with the sum of its indices i+ji+j, and then prints the array row by row.

* [2.c](./2.c): Calculates and prints the tax and levy on an income based on a progressive tax system with multiple income brackets. It takes the user's income as input and computes the tax for each bracket it falls into, displaying the tax breakdown at each level. Finally, it prints the total tax owed.

* [20.c](./20.c): Reads 5 integers from the user, shifts the elements in the array one position to the right, and moves the last element to the first position. Finally, it prints the modified array.

* [21.c](./21.c): Takes 5 real numbers as input and stores them in an array. It then calculates the absolute differences between consecutive numbers and stores them in a separate array. Finally, it prints both the original numbers and the computed absolute differences (except the last difference, as it doesn't exist for the last element).

* [22.c](./22.c): Effectively checks credit card validity using the widely used Luhn algorithm to detect errors in card numbers

* [3.c](./3.c): Takes an integer input n (up to 11) and prints the Pascal's Triangle up to the n-th row. It calculates each element of the triangle using the binomial coefficient formula.

* [4.c](./4.c): Calculates and displays the total sales collection for each seller, the supply (10% of the collection) for each seller, and the total amount of products sold in each product category.

* [5.c](./5.c): Reads a matrix from the user, calculates and displays the sum of each row, each column, and the diagonal sums (if the matrix is square). It uses a 2D array to store the matrix and computes sums accordingly.

* [6.c](./6.c): Takes two input values, constructs a 4x4 matrix based on those values, and calculates row sums, column sums, and diagonal sums. It checks if the sums of the diagonals are equal, determining if the matrix is a "magic square."

* [7.c](./7.c): Takes the dimensions and elements of two matrices AA and BB as input from the user. It uses two nested loops to fill each matrix with user-provided values but does not perform further operations.

* [8a.c](./8a.c): Reads a 2D array of integers from the user, flattens it into a 1D array, and then prints the 1D array.

* [8b.c](./8b.c): Converts the 1D inputted array into a 2D array (of specified dimensions) by copying the values and prints it.

* [9.c](./9.c): Reads a matrix of size M x N, then calculates and prints the minimum value in each row. It uses functions to read the matrix, find the row minimums, and display the results.

* [get_longlong.c](./get_longlong.c): Repeatedly prompts the user to input a valid long long integer, checking for unexpected characters or invalid input, and returns the valid number once entered. If the input is incorrect, it asks the user to try again.
