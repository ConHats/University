# Unit 7

* [1.c](./1.c): Takes a string as input and counts the occurrences of the character 'A' in the string. It then outputs the total count of 'A' characters found in the provided string. The program uses a simple loop to iterate through the string and checks each character for a match.

* [10.c](./10.c): Converts singular English words to their regular plural forms based on grammatical rules. The RegularPluralForm function appends appropriate suffixes (-s, -es, or -ies) depending on the word's ending. It processes multiple inputs and outputs the modified words after pluralization.

* [11.c](./11.c): Processes an email address entered by the user, separating it into the username and domain parts. It removes leading and trailing spaces, identifies the position of the '@' symbol, and extracts the username and server portions. The results, along with the username's length, are displayed.

* [12.c](./12.c): Records the names of passengers assigned to seats on a vehicle. It checks for duplicate entries, warns if a passenger already exists, and maintains a list of unique passengers. The program terminates when a specific condition (e.g., input containing '-') is met and displays the passenger list.

* [16.c](./16.c): Extracts digits from an input string, calculates their sum, and prints them in a summation format. If no digits are found, it informs the user

* [2.c](./2.c): Maps an integer input to its corresponding uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters and vice versa. The user inputs a positive integer (N) between 1 and 26, which is then mapped to its corresponding letters in the ASCII table. The program also accepts an uppercase letter (C) as input and calculates its position in the alphabet (1 for 'A', 2 for 'B', etc.). 

* [3.c](./3.c): Processes a user-input string to remove all spaces and counts the number of characters in the modified string (excluding spaces).

* [4.c](./4.c): Prompts the user to input an integer and formats the output to display the number padded with leading zeros to ensure a fixed width of 7 digits. The width can be customized by modifying the format specification.

* [5.c](./5.c): Prints all consonants from the English alphabet in both uppercase and lowercase. It excludes vowels using a helper function that checks if a character is not a vowel.

* [6.c](./6.c): Generates and prints five random words, each containing between 2 to 7 lowercase letters. The RandomWord function generates a random lowercase letter by selecting a value from the alphabet (a-z), and the main loop ensures that five random words are displayed with varying lengths.

* [7.c](./7.c): Calculates the Scrabble score of a given word based on standard tile values. The ScrabbleScore function evaluates each character in the input string, summing points according to predefined letter values, and returns the total score.

* [8.c](./8.c): Capitalizes the first letter of a given string while converting all other uppercase letters to lowercase. It processes the string using a custom Capitalize function.

* [9.c](./9.c): Takes a date (day, month, year) as input and formats it into a string with the format DD-MMM-YY, where DD represents the day, MMM represents the three-letter abbreviation of the month, and YY represents the last two digits of the year. The program outputs the formatted date string using a helper function DateString to convert and organize the date components.
