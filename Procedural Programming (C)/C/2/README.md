# Unit 2
* [10.c](./10.c): Calculates the total electricity bill based on consumption and category code. It computes the value of electricity used, adds a fixed charge, applies VAT, and then displays the final payment amount.

* [11.c](./11.c): Estimates the postage cost based on the weight of a package. If the weight is between 1 and 20, the postage cost is set to 250. If the weight is between 21 and 200, the postage cost is set to 600. For weights over 200, the cost is calculated as the weight multiplied by 4. Finally, the postage cost is printed.

* [12.c](./12.c): Calculates the postage cost for shipping based on the weight of the package and the country code. It first computes the additional cost based on weight, using different rates for different weight ranges. Then, it calculates a surcharge based on the country code. Finally, it sums the base cost, surcharge, and a fixed fee to determine the total postage cost and prints it.

* [13.c](./13.c): Gives the change a customer receives after purchasing a certain number of coffees, assuming the cost of each coffee is 70 cents and the customer pays 500 cents. It then breaks down the change into different coin denominations (2 EUR, 1 EUR, 50 cents, 20 cents, and 10 cents).

* [14.c](./14.c): Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs for weight and height, then classifies the result into categories such as "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight," or "Obese" based on BMI values.

* [15.c](./15.c): Checks the discriminant of a quadratic equation to find the roots: if the discriminant is positive, it prints two distinct real roots; if it's zero, it prints one real root; if negative, it indicates no real roots. If the leading coefficient a is zero, it also indicates no real roots.

* [16.c](./16.c): Determines the total cost for sending a specified number of SMS, applying different rates based on the quantity. It then displays the total cost in euros after converting from cents.

* [17.c](./17.c): Compares the number of passengers with available positions to assess the financial outcome. It prints "Profit" if passengers are greater than 50% of available positions, "Loss" if passengers are less than 30% of positions, and "Cost" for any other case.

* [18.c](./18.c): Calculates the fuel efficiency of a vehicle by comparing the liters of fuel consumed per mile traveled. It then categorizes the fuel efficiency as "Very low," "Low," "Normal," or "High" based on predefined thresholds.

* [19.c](./19.c): Determines the traffic fee based on the amount of CO2 emissions per kilometer. The fee is adjusted based on the CO2 level, with different rates applied for varying emission ranges.

* [20.c](./20.c): Takes an integer input from 1 to 7 and prints the corresponding day of the week. If the input is outside this range, it outputs an error message.

* [21.c](./21.c): Calculates an allowance based on the base salary and the number of children. It applies different percentage rates to the salary depending on the number of children, with specific rates for 1, 2, and 3 children, and a more complex calculation for cases with more than 3 children.

* [6.c](./6.c): Takes a number from 1 to 12 as input and prints the corresponding month name. If the number is outside this range, it prints "ERROR."

* [7.c](./7.c): Estimates the weekly salary based on either an annual salary (for employees with a code 1000 or above) or hourly wage and working hours (for employees with a code below 1000). If the working hours exceed 40, overtime is calculated at 1.5 times the regular wage.

* [8.c](./8.c): Compares the expected time with the real time, calculates the acceptable difference based on the expected time, and then categorizes the result as "BIG," "GOOD," or "SMALL" depending on the difference. It ensures that the acceptable difference is in line with the expected time ranges and provides feedback on whether the real time is acceptable.

* [9.c](./9.c): Calculates the final price of an order based on the product's code, the number of items, and the applicable discount. It determines the discount percentage based on the quantity of items ordered, then applies the discount to compute the total price.

* [a.c](./a.c): Evaluates the price based on a tax rate if the tax code is 'T', otherwise it prints an error message. The result is printed after applying the tax adjustment.

* [b.c](./b.c): Checks if the input code is equal to 1. If so, it takes two integers K and N, calculates their sum, and prints the result. If code is not 1, it outputs "ERROR".

* [c.c](./c.c): Calculates the value of B based on the input of A. If A is between 0 and 5, it computes B as the reciprocal of A squared, otherwise it computes B as A squared.

* [d.c](./d.c): Checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It uses conditions based on the rules of leap years (divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400) and outputs "true" for leap years and "false" for non-leap years.

* [e.c](./e.c): Assigns a cost based on the distance input. It checks the value of Distance and applies the corresponding cost based on the given ranges: 5 for distances 1-100, 8 for 101-500, 10 for 501-999, and 12 for distances of 1000 or more. Then it prints the Cost with one decimal place.

* [f.c](./f.c): Determines the number of days in a given month, accounting for leap years in February. It uses a switch statement to handle different months and applies conditions for leap years in February to output the correct number of days.
