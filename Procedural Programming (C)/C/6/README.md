# Unit 6

* [1.c](./1.c): Converts a given number of seconds (representing time in seconds since a certain point, such as system uptime) into hours, minutes, and seconds.

* [10.c](./10.c): Prompts the user to enter the dimensions of a 2D array (rows and columns) and then fills the array with values provided by the user. It then finds and displays the maximum value in the array.

* [10a.c](./10a.c): Collects data for grades of students in different classes and calculates the highest grade among all students.

* [10b.c](./10b.c): Handles the input of student grades from multiple classrooms, determines the maximum grade, and provides additional functionality such as finding the highest grade across all students and classrooms, as well as the highest grade per classroom.

* [11.c](./11.c): Reads daily temperature values for a month (30 days), calculates the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures, and then displays these statistics. It uses separate functions to read the temperatures and compute the desired statistics.

* [12.c](./12.c): Collects and processes the performance data of 8 athletes across three events (swimming, biking, and running). It calculates the highest scores and average scores for each event, identifies athletes who have an average score above 5, and prints the athlete IDs and their corresponding average scores.

* [13.c](./13.c): Decomposes a non-negative integer and calculates the number of digits in the number, the average of its digits and the maximum digit within the number.

* [2.c](./2.c): Reads integers from the user until -1 is entered. It stores each integer in an array and returns the count of numbers entered. It also finds the minimum and maximum values from the array using the count of numbers (counter). It updates the MAX and MIN values through pointers.

* [3.c](./3.c): Three integers are inputed, then it sorts them in ascending order by repeatedly swapping values between them. It uses a swap function to ensure that the values of the integers are rearranged such that the output shows them in increasing order.

* [4.c](./4.c): Takes a 10x20 matrix of integers from the user, then finds the minimum value in the matrix along with its position (row and column). It displays the minimum value and its position in the array.

* [5.c](./5.c): Reads a set of integers from the user into an array, then takes two numbers A and B as input, ensuring that A is smaller than B. It counts how many array elements are less than or equal to A, greater than or equal to B, and between A and B, and prints the results along with the array.

* [6.c](./6.c): Inputs data for 5 individuals, calculates the average values for weight, height, and age for men and women, and outputs these averages.

* [7.c](./7.c): Calculates and displays the average values of 5 rooms for each of 3 months, as well as the average values for each of the 3 months across all rooms. It also identifies the minimum value in a 5x3 array, along with its position, and prints the results.

* [8.c](./8c): Processes an array of 30 integers, counting the frequency of each number and finding the number with the highest frequency. It displays the frequencies of all unique numbers and then prints the number with the maximum frequency along with how many times it occurs.

* [9.c](./9.c): Calculates and displays the sales performance of salespeople and products. It computes total sales for each salesperson and the total number of items sold for each product, then identifies and prints the best salesperson and best-selling product based on sales figures.
