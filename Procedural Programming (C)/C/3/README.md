# Unit 3
* [10.c](./10.c): Generates and prints a multiplication table from 1 to 10. It uses nested for loops to calculate and format each product, displaying the table row by row.

* [11.c](./11.c): Prints a grid of asterisks where each of the 9 rows contains 5 asterisks. It uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns for pattern generation.

* [12.c](./12.c): Implements a basic menu-driven program that displays options for processing student data. The menu includes options to INSERT, EDIT, DELETE, SHOW, or EXIT, and prompts the user to select a choice. The program reads the user's input using GetInteger() and displays their choice.

* [13.c](./13.c): Estimates the sum of the harmonic series up to a user-defined limit NN, where each term is the reciprocal of the integers from 1 to NN. It then prints the result rounded to two decimal places.

* [14.c](./14.c): Calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It determines the number of digits using a while loop, then extracts each digit using the modulus and division operators in a for loop, summing them up.

* [15.c](./15.c): Prints numbers from 1 to 100 in a grid format, with 10 numbers per line.

* [16.c](./16.c): Calculates the average, highest, and second-highest grades from 100 input grades. It maintains the sum of all grades and finds the two maximum grades by comparing each entered grade.

* [17.c](./17.c): Prints the values of the function f(x)=x4−5x2+3f(x)=x4−5x2+3 for xx values from 0 to 1, incrementing by 0.05 at each step. The loop computes the function for each xx and outputs the result in the format "x = value, f(x) = result.

* [18.c](./18.c): Repeatedly asks for an amount input and sums up the amounts until the total reaches at least 100,000. It tracks the number of people, the total amount, the largest amount entered, and the smallest amount entered during the process.

* [19.c](./19.c): Searches the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It checks if the second number is greater than the first, swaps them if necessary, and then uses the algorithm to compute the GCD until the remainder r becomes zero. The program then prints the GCD of the two numbers.

* [1a.c](./1a.c): Calculates how many years it will take for the number of cars to exceed a specified limit, given a 7% annual growth rate. It outputs the number of years and the final car count.

* [1b.c](./1b.c): Finds the number of years required for a given initial number of cars to exceed a specified limit, based on a yearly rate of increase. It keeps updating the total number of cars each year and counts how many years it takes for the total to surpass the limit, then prints the number of years and the final number of cars.

* [20.c](./20.c): Continuously accepts user input for ages, keeps track of the oldest and youngest ages, and prints the results when the user enters -1. It outputs the oldest and youngest ages entered, with the oldest being the maximum and the youngest being the minimum.

* [21.c](./21.c): Evaluates the sum of integers from 1 to 20, excluding 5 and 15. It does this by first calculating the total sum of numbers from 1 to 20 and then subtracting 5 and 15 from the result. The final sum is then printed.

* [22.c](./22.c): Τakes a number NN as input and then prints a decreasing sequence starting from NN down to 0, with each number separated by a comma. It outputs the sequence in the format: "N, N-1, ..., 1, 0".

* [23.c](./23.c): Takes a number as input and checks if it is even or odd. If the number is even, it prints all even numbers from 0 to the entered number using a while loop. If the number is odd, it prints all odd numbers from 1 to the entered number using a for loop.

* [2a.c](./2a.c): Calculates how many years it will take for a tour company's total revenue to decrease below a specified limit, given a fixed annual reduction rate. The revenue starts at 13,500,000 and is reduced by 2.5% each year. The program prints the number of years it takes and the final revenue value.

* [2b.c](./2b.c): Estimates how many years it will take for a tourist transaction amount to decrease below a given limit, using a specified rate of decrease. It then prints the number of years and the final amount after the decrease.

* [3.c](./3.c): Finds the total cost of domestic and foreign boxes based on user input. For each input of domestic and foreign boxes, it calculates their individual costs and keeps a running total.

* [4.c](./4.c): Calculates the total price for booking vacancies based on the number of people, with a discount for groups over 10. It uses a password-protected interface to manage input and display the price for each booking. The program calculates the profit or loss after processing all entries, deducting a fixed amount of 20,000.

* [5.c](./5.c): Collects details of N individuals (code, gender, weight, height, and age) and identifies the oldest male (gender = 0). It then prints the code, gender, weight, height, and age of that individual.

* [6.c](./6.c): Γenerates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the Nth term. It initializes the first two terms (0 and 1), then iteratively calculates the subsequent terms by summing the last two terms, printing each value in the sequence.

* [7.c](./7.c): Uses two while loops: the first iterates to update and print the sum of I and K values, and the second decrements and prints Number from 4 down to 0. Afterward, it prints a line of asterisks.

* [8.c](./8.c): Initializes two integers II and KK, where KK starts at 5. It iterates II from −2−2 to 3, printing the sum of II and KK, then sets KK to 1 after the first iteration.

* [8b.c](./8b.c): Prints combinations of three integers (I, J, K) in a nested loop structure. For each combination of I and J from 1 to 3, it prints values of I, J, and K, where K ranges from I to J.

* [8c.c](./8c.c): Calculates the average of grades entered by the user. It repeatedly prompts for grades, sums them, counts how many are entered (stopping at -1), and then computes and displays the average.

* [8d.c](./8d.c): Finds, calculates and prints the values of K for each value of I using the formula K = I^3 - 3*I + 1. However, the loop condition I > 2 will never execute because I starts at 0 and the condition is false. Therefore, the program will not print anything or enter the loop. The program needs to adjust the loop condition to I <= 2 for it to function correctly.

* [9.c](./9.c): Continuously prompts the user to enter amounts and tracks the total sum, the largest amount, and the smallest amount until the total sum reaches or exceeds 100,000. It then displays the total number of entries, the total sum, and the largest and smallest amounts entered.
